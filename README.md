Rpi-hw v0.2.6
=============

### Description

[Rpi-hw](http://www.hackyourmind.org/blog/projects/rpi-hw/) is a free C++ library 
designed to manage the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) connector.
The library is released under terms of the [GNU LGPL v3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License).

The source of the latest version of Rpi-hw is available on [github.com](https://github.com/Wicker25/Rpi-hw) at:

- [https://github.com/Wicker25/Rpi-hw](https://github.com/Wicker25/Rpi-hw)

### Main functions

The following are some functions of the library:

* Low-level management of the GPIOs
* Generic input/output by interfaces
* Keypad support (matrix keypad)
* Display support (7-segments, HD44780 lcd)

### Compiling and install the library

First of all, you need to clone the Rpi-hw repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Wicker25/Rpi-hw

Then, compile and install the library with:

    $ cd Rpi-hw
    $ cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH>
    $ make
    # make install

Also, if you want a local copy of the documentation, 
you can generate it using [doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen):

    $ make doc

### Using the library

To use the library, you must include the main Rpi-hwâ€˜s header file into your program:

    // Include the main header file
    #include <rpi-hw.hpp>

Then, you link the program's file with the library object file, adding a command line argument to the compiler:

    $ g++ `pkg-config --libs --cflags rpi-hw` <SOURCE> -o <BIN>

Otherwise, you can use [CMake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) with the module `FindRpiHw.cmake` 
provided by the library. See the following example:

    # CMake's configuration

    # Set the minimum required version of cmake for this project
    cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )

    # Find Rpi-hw library on the operating system
    find_package( RpiHw )

    # Check if the library was found
    IF ( RPI_HW_FOUND )

        # Compile the project
        add_executable( <BIN> ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/<SOURCE> )

        # Link the library
        target_link_libraries( <BIN> ${RPI_HW_LIBRARIES} )

    ENDIF ( RPI_HW_FOUND )

### Documentation and examples

If you are looking for examples, you can find some into the directory of the source code,
